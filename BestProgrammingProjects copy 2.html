	</br></br><p align="left">This is my Inform Project called 'Lost in the Forest.' Inform is a coding language that revolves around text-based story-telling. This project is similar to a virtual game. The object is to arrive home and cure your sick mother. This was my first 'big' project and is still one of my favorite languages. This is an excerpt from the project that explains the story line and what the goal is. Although there is one 'main' goal, there are many obstacles that have to be solved before the main goal can be reached. This leads to trouble spots and loopholes that I had to fix in my code...</p></br>

	</br></br><p align="left">One of the components of my code was including a 'secret' room. This was difficult because this 'room' was actually a portal that led the player back home to their mother. However, if they had just choosen any direction to go and it happened to be this direction, they could finish the game without going through the nessecary steps. This also got rid of the 'challenge' element of the project. To solve this problem, I had to make an 'if' statement that said if the player was not carrying certain items, they could not go that direction.</br></br>Another bug that I had experienced was the stone that needed to be pushed to reach the key. I also had to learn how to make the stone an enterable supporter so the player could step on it.</p>

<div class="container-fluid bg-2 text-center"> <!-- This is the second class meaning that it can be declared by the CSS -->
	<h3>SCRATCH</h3></br>
	<!-- Image of Produce -->
	<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/35854xf.png" style="display:inline" width="500" height="400">
	</br></br><p align="left">Scratch was a language where our class was first introduced to blocks. The project above is my final Project which is a Paleolithic Quiz. We had to relate this project to one of the topics we were learning in class so I tied mine with Social Science, which was the Paleolithic and Neolithic Age. I had a lot of fun with this project because after I got through the coding all I had to do was edit the sprites. I also added music, and bells that signified the music being on or off. There were some loopholes that I had to patch up, but I learned a lot from this project such as timing, broadcasts, and how to make comments on blocks. We also used blocks for an activity for Hour of Code, so this really helped me understand how each block works together to make a product.</p></br> 
	<!-- Description of Scratch -->
	<img src="http://i64.tinypic.com/2hyz09y.png" style="display:inline" width="600" height="370">
	</br></br><p align="left">One thing that was harder to fit together and make come out right were the monkeys. When you first open the quiz, there are two monkey that walk back and forth, never touching each other or the wall. First I had to see how many steps they had to take before they touched the wall, and then I had to coordinate them so they were facing eachother when they came towards the middle, and opposite direction when they were going towards the wall. I also had to make sure that they would restart every time the person went back to the home screen and that they were coordinated. </br></br>Another thing that I learned about was broadcast. This feature helps make other sprites seemingly 'disappear' or 'appear' when a certain broadcast is called out. Broadcast was also a very helpful feature because it allowed my questions to show up and hide when I wanted them to.</p>

	<img src="https://i.imgflip.com/10f7yj.gif" style="display:inline" width="460" height="340">
	</br></br><p align="left">The Meggy Jr is actually just the machine that you see in the picture above. However, the code that I completed was actually on an app that I downloaded called Arduino. Connecting the Meggy Jr and Arduino was a long and grueling journey (just kidding), but it was worth it. I really liked the Meggy because it's like an actual game controller except for the fact that the game is actually on the controller as well. The project that I did is called "Final Meggy Project," which is a pretty explanatory title. This was a game that was difficult. The purpose of the game was to reach the other side of the Meggy without dying. Though it sounds easy at first, there were a number of obstacles that made it extremely challenging. Also, there were multiple waves of red 'bombers' that could kill the player.</p></br> 
	<!-- Description of Meggy -->
	<img src="http://i67.tinypic.com/iqzn1s.png" style="display:inline" width="500" height="400">
	</br></br><p align="left">One of the hardest parts of this game was coding for the bombs. I had to create two arrays that made the bombers go across the screen. There were two sets of arrays: xbombs1 and xbombs2. The code says that once xbomb1 reaches 7 on the x-axis, xbomb2 should start running across the screen. This made the game extremely challenging because the player would have to move fast to reach the finishing line. A bug was that the player would move rather slowly, but I learned how to make it steady so that the player must pace themselves enough that they can reach the other side of the screen. One thing that I thought was very peculiar was that because I made the game, it was pretty easy for me to accomplish the games that I made. This was proof that if I can complete the game, anyone can.</p>

	</br></br><p align="left">Processing wasn't a language that we spent a lot of time on, but it was a fun language. Our assignment was to go on a website, find a project made in the Processing language, and mod it to make it our own. I found this app that intrigued me because it had a bunch of balls that slowly followed the cursor around. Taking this, I changed it up a lot so that you wouldn't really be able to tell that it was the same app.</p></br> 
	<!-- Description of Processing -->
	<img src="http://i64.tinypic.com/hx0xz6.png" style="display:inline" width="500" height="400">
	</br></br><p align="left">I changed the window size (when you opened it) so that the height was longer than before. Another thing I changed was making the balls look more bubbles. I also changed the attraction of the balls to the cursor so that the balls couldn't all be gathered in one spot (I did that with the original). Then I changed the velocity of the balls when they were flung against the wall by speeding it up, originally they had moved rather slowly. Above there is a comment that says "this makes the attraction to the mouse weaker" that shows where I changed the numbers.</p>

			<p>InVision is a project that deeply involves the way an app is designed and where things are positioned. This doesn't involve word coding, but there are 'hotspots' that, when pressed, lead to another screens which become prototypes.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></br>
<p align="left">My InVision project is an app called Dog Destiny. This is the beginning of the app, where I started with three screens. A few days earlier my dog had passed, so I had a strong pull towards a dog app. Although this is not very practical, it could be a useful app for people who are looking to buy a dog or have to do research about a certain type of dogs, or perhaps their connection to humans. This is an app for people of all ages, because all age groups can find friends in dogs! The first thing that I did was draw the screens on paper and these became the first few 'screens' of my Dog Destiny app.</p></br></br>

			<p>The first screen is the home screen where the user is greeted. The next screen shows a list of dogs and in the imagined app, there would be a bunch of dogs in alphabetical order. There would also be a 'topics' place where each topic would have a list of dogs that fall in that place.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></br>
<p align="left">There are many things that are important tips to user interface because most people get very used to where things. One of these important things is having the 'Back' button in the top left button because that's what most people are used to. Another thing is when something such as an ad pops up, the 'X' button is usually located in the top right corner.</p>

	<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/11hdz0o.png" style="display:inline" width="700" height="470">
	</br></br><p align="left">Swift was a language that we focused a lot of attention on because there were so many parts to it. The first thing we did was go on the playground, where we learned the basics of the language. This also involves using the app called XCode that the company Apple allows other to do to create Apps. This was one of the first projects that I did called PrimeOrComposite and was a calculator that tested if the number the user put in was prime or composite. This is a picture of the project actually working using the number 677. It seems that this number is composite!</p></br> 
	<!-- Description of Swift (Non-App) -->
	<img src="http://i66.tinypic.com/257ixz8.png" style="display:inline" width="700" height="470">
	</br></br><p align="left">One of the major issues that I found out was that if you use the perfect square, the app would say that the number was prime and not composite. The code above shows that you had to do the sqrt function to make sure that the number was not an even number if you did the square root of it. I also learned how to change the name of the variable 'pc' from prime to composite when the number is composite. I really enjoyed this project and thought it was quite clever and useful.</p>

	</br></br><p align="left">Swift was a really fun program to work with because, in projects, you could combine the functions of user interface and code. One project that I did in Swift was called the Tip Calculator. This App's function is exactly how it sounds: it calculated tips for when you went out, etc. First, we followed the instructions from a website that showed step-by-step ways of completing the calculator. Then, we modded it ourselves! By doing this project I was first introduced to a stimulation on a life-size screen (this one was the iPhone 6s), and how it would look if you turned it a different way.</p></br>

	<img src="http://i68.tinypic.com/34ns9l0.png" style="display:inline" width="700" height="470">
	</br></br><p align="left">There was user interface, which could get very complicated but it helped because we could actually design it by moving things around. However, one of the hardest parts was attaching the interface and the code so that they knew how to work together. This is because there was a lot of dragging, entering, and more. Above, there is the code that first started out the project- telling the computer how to do math. There is also code that shows what will appear when you first look at the app as well as different options of what percentage you want to tip.</p>

	</br></br><p align="left">App Inventor 2 is a language that combines user interface and coding. However, instead of words they use blocks so things such as semicolons and etc. won't trip you up if you accidentally code wrong! This is a fun program that has an emulator which produces the final product. This is a good app that shows games and other useful products. The project that I did is called "Magic8Ball" and is similar to the physical one. However instead of shaking, you record your question and you get your answer once you stop recording.</p></br>

	</br></br><p align="left">This was only the second project that I did with App Inventor, therefore there aren't a lot of blocks of code. However, this code was tricky because there were some things that were hard to find. It got easier as I worked on it more, which is really important to remember when working with code and new languages. This was really fun to work on because it was nice to see the code becoming something and actually produce something that other people could play and test out.</p></br>

	</br></br><p align="left">HTML/CSS is one of my most favorite languages because before I started taking this class, I had kind of modded HTML and CSS before. Of course, I love CSS because it has the visual effects on all the code. On General Assembly Dash, I was brought through a series of step-by-step instructions that showed me the basics of html, tricks, and ways to make websites look fancier. This is the second project from Dash and I modded it from a person's profile to Drivin' Pizza! This website is designed so that you can order pizza, read pizza news, and look at the pizza calendar. One of my most favorite parts of this website is that there is a gif that shows someone pushing a button and pizza is getting delivered (that was the inspiration for the theme).</p></br>

	</br></br><p align="left">One interesting thing that I learned from using HTML and CSS is how it can also use Javascript to create things like alerts, like the one above. This is one of my very first modded projects using HTML, and I learned how the Javascript button works. In this case, if you 'Read More' on one of my stories, an alert button will come up and tell the reader that they clicked it. Of course, this is impractical but I understand how Javascript would be helpful for different functions. I also had a great time coming up with these stories :)</p>

	</br></br><p align="left">Python reminds me a lot of HTML because of the colors! I like this language a lot because it has taught me a lot of things and with the programs that we had to make for homework, it has been really good. One of these programs is called DiceProblem and the goals was to show the number of times 2-12 came up as the sum when two dice were rolled 1000 times. The purpose of this program was to see how similar the numbers were when they were rolled. As you can see, none of them appeared over 50 times.</p></br>

	</br></br><p align="left">This program especially was pretty grueling to create because it involved functions, which took a little while to make come together and make sense.

	<h3>TIPS</h3></br>
	<p>Sometimes coding can feel like this:</p></br>
	<img src="http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/22/13/imagebuzz/webdr15/anigif_optimized-14036-1434994420-1.gif"></br></br>
	<p align="left">Especially when things get stressful! It's important to take remember to take breaks if you've been coding for long amounts of time. Coding can be tricky when small things such as a space or a ; are out of place. As you work with coding more and more, it'll be easier to spot these ridiculous mistakes and improve on them. Trust me, the moment when you find the mistake and its a small misplaced ; or a /, it's one that will be priceless.</p></br></br>
	<p>A lot of times this will happen:</p></br>
	<img src="https://sunsetmediawave.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/2-1.gif" width="400" height="250"></br></br>
	<p align="left">It's important to know what your code is doing! Sometimes it can be hard to remember certain functions or understand why something is happening when you know it shouldn't be because you didn't code it! Make sure that you literally type out the code and not copy/paste because you can learn what things do what by typing it out. It's also very important to add comments to your code! Almost every single coding website will have a comment feature for their code so use it! This will help a lot if you're confused by your code.</p></br></br>
	<p>And this...</p></br>
	<img src="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/417/967/fad.gif" width="400" height="250"></br></br>
