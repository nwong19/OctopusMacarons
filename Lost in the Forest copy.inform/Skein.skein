You are lost in the forest looking for a specific type of herb. The herb you are looking for is called Holy Basil. It&apos;s purple and tall. You need the herb to heal your sick mother. You don&apos;t know your way back home and assume you have strayed very far from your home. You can&apos;t retrace your steps. You&apos;re pretty sure that you&apos;ve been walking in circles for the past hour and a half. The goal is to find your way home, find the Holy Basil, and overcome difficult tasks that come your way.

Lost in the Forest
An Interactive Fiction by Natalie Wong
Release 1 / Serial number 160214 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Forest
The forest has many different trees. They are all about 20 meters high and the lowest branch is 3 feet above you. You see a key and a stone lying on the ground. You are lost in the forest and want to find a way home and the Holy Basil to heal your sick mother. There is a clearing in the North. There are more trees n

Southeast. I think I saw a Lady who can help you in the North.

The key hangs from a branch. You can&apos;t reach it. It unlocks a treasure chest.

Home
&quot;Wait!&quot; say the Lady. Her arm is out trying to stop you. With the other arm, the Lady takes out a perfume bottle, sprays once, and a magical portal appears. 

 &quot;Go on,&quot; says that Lady. &quot;When you walk through the portal, you will arrive safe at home.&quot; 
 
You decide to trust the Lady, after all she told you how to get the key. You walk forward and the Lady gives an encouraging nod. She smiles slightly and you walk into the portal. 
 
You feel a cool breeze around your body and suddenly you&apos;re back at home. 
 
&quot;Are you home?&quot; calls your mother. Better go see what she needs!

You see a mirror. You should take the mirror. Welcome Home!

    *** After you took the mirror, you looked very much the same. You saved your mother using the Holy Basil. You never did see the Lady again, but you always thought of her. Like &quot;How did she even use a PERFUME bottle to open a portal?&quot; you never found the answer, but you knew you were always in her debt. Although she stared at you quite creepily. ***

Home
&quot;Wait!&quot; say the Lady. Her arm is out trying to stop you. With the other arm, the Lady takes out a perfume bottle, sprays once, and a magical portal appears. 

 &quot;Go on,&quot; says that Lady. &quot;When you walk through the portal, you will arrive safe at home.&quot; 
 
You decide to trust the Lady, after all she told you how to get the key. You walk forward and the Lady gives an encouraging nod. She smiles slightly and you walk into the portal. 
 
You feel a cool breeze around your body and suddenly you&apos;re back at home. 
 
&quot;Are you home?&quot; calls your mother. Better go see what she needs!

You see a mirror. You should take the mirror. Welcome Home!

The forest has many different trees. They are all about 20 meters high and the lowest branch is 3 feet above you. You see a key and a stone lying on the ground. You are lost in the forest and want to find a way home and the Holy Basil to heal your sick mother. There is a clearing in the North. There is more trees in the Southeast.

Forest
The forest has many different trees. They are all about 20 meters high and the lowest branch is 3 feet above you. You see a key and a stone lying on the ground. You are lost in the forest and want to find a way home and the Holy Basil to heal your sick mother. There is a clearing in the North. There is more trees in the Southeast. I think I saw a Lady who can help you in the North.

Home
&quot;Wait!&quot; says the Lady. Her arm is out trying to stop you. With the other arm, the Lady takes out a perfume bottle, sprays once, and a magical portal appears. 

 &quot;Go on,&quot; says that Lady. &quot;When you walk through the portal, you will arrive safe at home.&quot; 
 
You decide to trust the Lady, after all she told you how to get the key. You walk forward and the Lady gives an encouraging nod. She smiles slightly and you walk into the portal. 
 
You feel a cool breeze around your body and suddenly you&apos;re back at home. 
 
&quot;Are you home?&quot; calls your mother. Better go see what she needs!

You see a mirror. You should take the mirror. Welcome Home!

&quot;Wait!&quot; says the Lady. Her arm is out trying to stop you. With the other arm, the Lady takes out a perfume bottle, sprays once, and a magical portal appears. 

 &quot;Go on,&quot; says that Lady. &quot;When you walk through the portal, you will arrive safe at home.&quot; 
 
You decide to trust the Lady, after all she told you how to get the key. You walk forward and the Lady gives an encouraging nod. She smiles slightly and you walk into the portal. 
 
You feel a cool breeze around your body and suddenly you&apos;re back at home. 
 
&quot;Are you home?&quot; calls your mother. Better go see what she needs!

You see a mirror. You should take the mirror. Welcome Home!

    *** After you took the mirror, you looked very much the same. You saved your mother using the Holy Basil. You never did see the Lady again, but you always thought of her. Like &quot;How did she even use a PERFUME bottle to open a portal?&quot; you never found the answer, but you knew you were always in her debt. Although she stared at you quite creepily. ***

Home
&quot;Wait!&quot; says the Lady. Her arm is out trying to stop you. With the other arm, the Lady takes out a perfume bottle, sprays once, and a magical portal appears. 

 &quot;Go on,&quot; says that Lady. &quot;When you walk through the portal, you will arrive safe at home.&quot; 
 
You decide to trust the Lady, after all she told you how to get the key. You walk forward and the Lady gives an encouraging nod. She smiles slightly and you walk into the portal. 
 
You feel a cool breeze around your body and suddenly you&apos;re back at home. 
 
&quot;Are you home?&quot; calls your mother. Better go see what she needs!

You see a mirror. You should take the mirror. Welcome Home!

You have gotten lost in the forest looking for a specific type of herb. The herb you are looking for is called Holy Basil. It&apos;s purple and tall. You need the herb to heal your sick mother. Right now, you&apos;re lost in the forest and you don&apos;t know how to go back home. You have strayed very far from your home and can&apos;t retrace your steps. You&apos;re pretty sure that you&apos;ve been walking in circles for the past hour and a half. The goal is to find a way home, find the Holy Basil, and overcome difficult tasks.

Lost in the Forest
An Interactive Fiction by Natalie Wong
Release 1 / Serial number 150902 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Forest
The forest has many different trees. They are all about 20 meters high and the lowest branch is 3 feet above you. You see a key and a stone lying on the ground. You are lost in the forest and want to find a way home and the Holy Basil to heal your sick mother. There is a clearing in the North. There is more trees in the Southeast. I think I saw a Lady who can help you in the North.

The key hangs from a branch. You can&apos;t reach it. It unlocks a treasure chest.

Clearing
In the clearing stands a Lady who looks at you. She doesn&apos;t acknowledge you in any way, just stares. You are a bit freaked out but you don&apos;t say anything. Maybe you should ask her about the key. You should ask her about the purple plant as well. It doesn&apos;t hurt to make new friends once in a while!

Home
The Lady takes out a perfume bottle, sprays once, and a magical portal appears. 

 &quot;Go on,&quot; says that Lady. &quot;When you walk through the portal, you will arrive safe at home.&quot; 
 
You decide to trust the Lady, after all she told you how to get the key. You walk forward and the Lady gives an encouraging nod. She smiles slightly and you walk into the portal. 
 
You feel a cool breeze around your body and suddenly you&apos;re back at home. 
 
&quot;Are you home?&quot; calls your mother. Better go tend to her needs!

A ladder is leaning against a tree. Might this have some use for you? Besides, you don&apos;t see a ladder everyday in the middle of the forest.

Home
&quot;Wait!&quot; says the Lady. Her arm is out trying to stop you. With the other arm, the Lady takes out a perfume bottle, sprays once, and a magical portal appears. 

 &quot;Go on,&quot; says that Lady. &quot;When you walk through the portal, you will arrive safe at home.&quot; 
 
You decide to trust the Lady, after all she told you how to get the key. You walk forward and the Lady gives an encouraging nod. She smiles slightly and you walk into the portal. 
 
You feel a cool breeze around your body and suddenly you&apos;re back at home. 
 
&quot;Are you home?&quot; calls your mother. Better go heal her with the Holy Basil you collected in the forest!

You see a mirror. You should take the mirror. Welcome Home!

Clearing
In the clearing stands a Lady who looks at you. She doesn&apos;t acknowledge you in any way, just stares. You are a big freaked out but you don&apos;t say anything. Maybe you should ask her about the key. It doesn&apos;t hurt to make new friends once in a while!
