MeggyJr Reflection

1. What is your project?

My project is a game where a player has to avoid certain obstacles to reach the goal.

2. How can the user interact with your project?

By using the buttons (up, down, right, left) they can move across the screen.

3. What is the ultimate goal?

To get to the top of the grid. There you will be met with the winning screensaver.

4. What are the obstacles that must be overcome to achieve the ultimate goal?

There are two arrays. One is an array that goes steadily across the screen. The other is like a timer and will only move foward if the first array is in a certain place. It eventually will meet up with the first array and you will die if you don't get to the goal by a certain amount of time. 

5. Other than to complete an assignment, what did you want to accomplish by creating this project?

I wanted to show that I could code that part where the bombs go across the screen. I knew that it was going to be one of the most difficult parts, and I'm really happy that it turned out the way it did.

6. How well does this project accomplish what you set out to do?

The project exceeds my expectations. I didn't think the project would turn out the way it did. I'm really happy that it turned out so well and I'm proud that it turned out to be something playable, and not just jumbled code.

7. Discuss in detail a time when you got stuck, and how you got unstuck.

There was this time when I had one array of bombs going across the screen and was working perfectly. For some reason, there was another array going across the screen that I hadn't coded. It was turning crazy colors and everytime it ran over my player, my player would go to the top of the screen. It was really frustrating and I had no idea what the problem was because I hadn't even put the code in. Turned out it was happening because my Meggy was running out of batteries. I also talked to my teacher and she helped get my code back on track.

8. Tell of a time a classmate helped you and of a time you were able to help a classmate with this assignment.

Hypatia and I helped eachother with our projects. Nothing that was really notable, but I think that without her help, my project would have a lot of loopholes. I'm glad that we got eachothers small mistakes before they turned into big problems.

9. If you could improve on your project in one way, what would that be?

I would spend more time on it, and add additional feautures like using the LED lights more creatively. I would also make my project start at the beginning after the winnning screensaver. Although, I really like the way my project turned out.

10. Whose project did you test?  What valuable feedback were you able to give them? 

I tested Kelly's, Hypatia's, and Alofa's. I didn't really give any suggestions to Kelly because she had so many bugs and basically smoothed them all out when I tested it. She did a really good job! For Hypatia's project, I helped fix a couple bugs. There was one where I found a way to get to her goal really easily because the player looped around the walls. Alofa's was good, I know she had her own problem with the noise, but besides that it was good.

11. Who beta tested your project? How did their feedback help you with your own project?

Everyone in the class beta-tested my project. Almost all of them told me that my player was lagging, so I fixed that. That was basically my only problem. Some people thought it was hard, others thought it was easy. 

12. Consider your whole experience with Arduino and the Meggy Jr RGB.

This has been interesting experience, but it has gone in a breeze. I enjoyed working with the Meggy Jr because it’s much more interactive than the other websites we’ve done because there is an actual device instead of just a website. I think that the programming is much more complex and you really have to understand what does what in the code. Pseudocode is a really helpful tool when using the Meggy.

13. What do you like about programming for the Meggy Jr?

I like learning a new language because it’s kind of fun knowing what a certain phrase means and someone else who doesn’t take the class doesn’t really understand it. I also like that there was a machine that you could hold and press buttons. 

14. What was challenging about programming with the Meggy Jr?

Definitely figuring out what all the code meant and why it was important that you needed it. Like I said before, pseudocoding was really helpful to understand the language. Figuring out when you could put a semicolon, periods, and curly brackets was also challenging, but once I figured it out, it didn’t seem to be as big of a problem for me. 

15. What resources were the most useful for the questions you had about Meggy Jr and Arduino?

Mrs. Kiang was really useful and also the guide on first using the Meggy Jr was useful. I got a good grasp on the knowledge using the guide. Also Mrs. Kiang was very helpful when I emailed her about the endless questions that I had about the MeggyJR.

16. What advice would you give to someone just starting to learn to code for an Arduino device?

Be patient. The Meggy is so frustrating half the time, while the other time you think your code is good, but then you find a bug. Patience is key because it’s so frustrating to work with the code and figuring out what it means. Actually getting the Meggy to work is also very challenging, but will patience you’ll end up with a great game, or product. 

17. What are you most proud of regarding your programming abilities and projects, so far this school year?

Honestly, I’m just happy that I know something that others don’t. The programming world is so different from the language that we speak and you learn a lot. Once you take programming, you realize how much of it is used in the world around us. I watched the movie The Martian and they were talking about using hexadecimals to communicate with NASA. I freaked out because I actually understood what they were talking about (my Mom didn’t). 

Of course, I like the experience and being able to understand that code really impresses myself and I think it may impress others.
