	<h3>INFORM</h3></br>
	<img src="file:///Users/nataliewong1/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202016-02-14%20at%203.46.06%20PM.png" class="img-responsive img-square" style="display:inline" width="500" height="500">
	</br></br><p align="left">This is my Inform Project called 'Lost in the Forest.' Inform is a coding language that revolves around text-based story-telling. This project is similar to a virtual game. The object is to arrive home and cure your sick mother. This was my first 'big' project and is still on of my favorite languages. This is an excerpt from the project that explains the story line and what the goal is. Although there is one 'main' goal, there are many obstacles that have to be solved before the main goal can be reached. This leads to trouble spots and loopholes that I had to fix in my code...</p></br>

	</br></br><p align="left">One of the components of my code was including a 'secret' room. This was difficult because this 'room' was actually a portal that led the player back home to their mother. However, if they had just choosen any direction to go and it happened to be this direction, then they could finish the game without going through the nessecary steps. This also got rid of the 'challenge' element of the project. To solve this problem, I had to make an 'if' statement that said if the player was not carrying certain items, they could not go that direction.</br></br>Another bug that I had experienced was the stone that needed to be pushed to reach the key. I also had to learn how to make the stone an enterable supporter so the player could step on it.</p>

			<p>InVision is a project that deeply involves the way an app is designed and where things are positioned. This doesn't involve word coding, but there are 'hotspots' that, when pressed, lead to another screens which become prototypes.</p>

	</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></br>
<p align="left">My InVision project is an app called Dog Destiny. This is the beginning of the app, where I started with three screens. A few days earlier my dog had passed, so I had a strong pull towards a dog app. Although this is not very practical, it could be a useful app for people who are looking to buy a dog or have to do research about a certain type of dogs, or perhaps their connection to humans. This is an app for people of all ages, because all age groups can find friends in dogs! The first thing that I did was draw the screens on paper and these became the first few 'screens' of my Dog Destiny app.</p></br></br>

			<p>The first screen is the home screen where the user is greeted. The next screen shows a list of dogs and in the imagined app, there would be a bunch of dogs in alphabetical order. There would also be a 'topics' place where each topic would had a list of dogs that fall in that place.</p>

<p align="left">There are many things that are important tips to user interface because most people get very used to where things. One of these important things is having the 'Back' button in the top left button because that's what most people are used to. Another thing is when something such as an ad pops up, the 'X' button is usually located in the top right corner.</p>

	<h3>APP INVENTOR 2</h3></br>
	<img src="file:///Users/nataliewong1/Desktop/Screen%20Shot%202016-02-14%20at%204.16.39%20PM.png" width="600" height="350">
	</br></br><p align="left">App Inventor 2 is a language that combines user interface and coding. However, instead of words they use blocks so things such as semicolons and etc. won't trip you up if you acidentally code wrong! This is a fun program that has an emulator which produces the final product. This is a good app that shows games and other useful products. The project that I did is called "Magic8Ball" and is similar to the physical one. However instead of shaking, you record your question and you get your answer once you stop recording.</p></br>

	</br></br><p align="left">This was only the second project that I did with App Inventor, therefore there aren't a lot of blocks of code. However, this code was tricky because there was some things that were hard to find. It got easier as I worked on it more, which is really important to remember when working with code and new languages. This was really fun to work on because it was nice to see the code becoming something and actually produce something that other people could play and test out.</p></br>

	<h3>TIPS</h3></br>
	<p>Sometimes coding can feel like this:</p></br>
	<img src="http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/22/13/imagebuzz/webdr15/anigif_optimized-14036-1434994420-1.gif"></br></br>
	<p align="left">Especially when things get stressful! It's important to take remeber to take breaks if you've been coding for long amounts of time. Coding can be tricky when small things such as a space or a ; are out of place. As you work with coding more and more, it'll be easier to spot these ridiculous mistakes and improve on them. Trust me, the moment when you find the mistake and its a small misplaced ; or a /, it's one that will be priceless.</p></br></br>
	<p>A lot of times this will happen:</p></br>
	<img src="https://sunsetmediawave.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/2-1.gif" width="400" height="250"></br></br>
	<p align="left">It's important to know what you're code is doing! Sometimes it can be hard to remember certain functions or understand why something is happening when you know it shouldn't be because you didn't code it! Make sure that you literally type out the code and not copy/paste because you can learn what things do what by typing it out. It's also very important to add comments to your code! Almost every single coding website will have a comment feature for their code so use it! This will help a lot if you're confused by your code.</p></br></br>
	<p>And this...</p></br>
	<img src="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/417/967/fad.gif" width="400" height="250"></br></br>
	<p align="left"> Take your time, because when things are rushed, your computer <u>will</u> explode. Just kidding. But, when things <i>are</i> rushed, that's when mistakes happen.</p></br></br>
	<p>There's a whole coding community!</p></br>
	<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ZZXYjjPCMTlRe/giphy.gif"></br></br>
	<p align="left">There are a bunch of people who will help you with your code as well as many reliable sources on the internet. If you're hesitant about coding, you should start! It's an awesome experience that you can learn a lot from.</p>
